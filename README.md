Coding tasks for the first-year students to get into the Amrita Blockchain Club.

1. Develop a simple login page: Input the username and password from the user, convert them into respective hashes, and store them in a text file or csv file. Implement both Register and Login functionality. (No UI required; implement it in the command line interface.)
